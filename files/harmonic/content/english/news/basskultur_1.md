We took a trip to Regensburg for Basskultur #1 by the Farmer Soundsystem.
Idren G from Jah Chalice Soundsystem was also at the controls that evening.

Both Idren G and the Farmer Soundsystem gave us a danceable evening with a hard bassline and a good mix of roots, dubs and steppas. Throughout the night, we were able to listen to some new releases that will be released in the coming months.
